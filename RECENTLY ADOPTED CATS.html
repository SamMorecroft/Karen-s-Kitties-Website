			<h2>Tiggy</h2>
			<p>Tiggy is a beautiful British Shorthair of around 18 years old. Her owner died leaving many animals.</p>
			<p>The family managed to home all the other pets, but Tiggy was so shut down and traumatised that she was left at a local vets.</p>
			<p>They contacted us and asked for help. We fostered her for a few weeks and she showed no interest in anything.</p>
			<p>One of our memberes contacted us and offered to take her on as a foster, with a view to adopt her if things worked out.</p>
			<p>Fortunately this arrangement worked out perfectly. The results have been amazing, Tiggy loves her new Mum and her foster brother, a beautiful litter Persian cat called Harry. She has learnt to relax, love and trust again. She is certainly living her best life.</p>
