			<h1>January 2026</h1>
			<p>It has been a really hectic month for us. Non stop in fact, as well as trying to organise Fundraising events and deal with personal problems.</p>
			<p>It is only due to the support we get from our members and Carole soldiering on with knitting and auctions, that enables us to deal with this volume of rescues.</p>
			<p>Thank you everyone.</p>
			<h2>Flossie</h2>
			<p>Flossie was already here before me thanks to Kerry Silke who caught her in the park.</p>
			<p>Karen along with Jennie's kind neighbour Janet had taken her into Jennie's home.  She is doing really well and she is pregnant.</p>

			<h2>Felicity</h2>
			<p>Felicity the last of the Gorse Hill trio, took an additional 2 days to catch. We walked miles, knocked doors and did a leaflet drop in the area. It's a good job we got her when we did. She was in the early stages of Pyometra. She would most certainly have died an agonising death. HAPPILY,  now adopted into a lovely home.</p>

			<h2>Midnight & Dora</h2>
			<p>Our most recent rescue. A much loved Mother and Daughter. Sadly the owner is in poor health and can no longer look after them.</p>
			<p>We will get them checked and vaccinated and we will be looking for a home that will take the two girls together.</p>

			<h2>Bennie</h2>
			<p>Poor boy, spent years on the streets looking for handouts from kind people. We have never seen a cat in such a bad condition as this poor boy. He took days for us to track and trap. We sat for nearly 5 hours the night we eventually got him. He required emergency treatment and an overnight stay at PetMedics. Has recently been to Timperley Vets for castration and 1st vaccination.</p>

			<h2>Oreo/Beans</h2>
			<p>Oreo/Beans had been missing from home for around 2 years. A lady close by had got her a cat house and was looking after her. She put a final post on Facebook and as a result was contacted by the owner. We were contacted and managed to trap her and take her home.</p>
			<h2>Smudge</h2>
			<p>We just checked the chip on this cat and he was with his owner in no time.</p>
