			<p>Thank you to everyone who has already made a monthly commitment to our Fundraising  Account.</p>
			<p>It really does make a big difference, knowing that we have regular funds coming in to help the ever increasing number of cats that we are rescuing from the streets.</p>
			<p>It really would be a great help if you could make a small regular donation.</p>
			<p>If anyone would like to set up a monthly Standing order, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
			<p>The details are below.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This would be purely on a VOLUNTARY basis.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With a STANDING ORDER, YOU would be totally in charge.</p>
			<p>You choose:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>START DATE …..Any day, date that suits you.</li>
				<li>FREQUENCY  ….weekly, monthly, payday.</li>
				<li>AMOUNT.   ………Anything upwards from £1.00 (Every pound counts).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have set up a spreadsheet to give us an idea of how much money to expect in a month YOUR  PERSONAL donation would be PRIVATE between Jennie and Karen.</p>
			<p>It’s easy to set up a STANDING ORDER either online or by filling in a standing order mandate at your Bank.</p>
			<p>(Anyone struggling to do this please see the CONTACT US page, send us a message and we will help)</p>
			<p>Donations to Karen’s Kitties, can be sent by bank transfer to…</p>
			<p>Sort code.              110671</p>
			<p>Account number.  11054963</p>
			<p>Payee.                    Karen Sykes</p>
			<p>REFERENCE           Name of the cat you have adopted</p>
			<p>                    Or just your name if a kind donation.</p>
			<p>This can be stopped at any time you wish. All I ask is that you message us so that we can keep the spreadsheet up to date.</p>
			<p>If you do go ahead and set up the payment, please message us, with the amount, start date and frequency, thank you all so much for reading. The numbers of strays,ferals and cruelly dumped cats at the moment  is totally overwhelming</p>
			<p>The minimum acceptable donation to adopt a cat is £50. Kitten £65.</p>
