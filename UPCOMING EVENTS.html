			<h3>Chestnut Drive Christmas Lights</h3>
			<p>We are on our final countdown, working hard to get everything in place for the Switch On 6pm, next Saturday 29th November.</p>
			<p>Our aim is to give everyone who attends a night to remember and get as many donations of gifts and cash for our two chosen causes. Please refer to earlier posts of how to donate. Plus the QR codes for both causes are on this post and can be scanned.</p>
			<p>As well as the previously requested new unwrapped toys and gifts for children aged between 0 and 18 years there will be collection buckets going round on the night for MISSION CHRISTMAS. Please bring change, card payments are also accepted.</p>
			<p>KAREN'S KITTIES who have been granted a Temporary Entertainment Notice (displayed below) will be selling Mulled Wine, Hot Vimto, Hot chocolate and Childrens Lucky Bags on the driveway of number 81 Chestnut Drive. Both cash and card payments accepted.</p>
			<p>Please come along and join us. It  will be a magical evening, for both young and old.</p>
