			<h2>History of Karen's Kitties</h2>
			<p>Karen’s Kitties was set up by Karen Sykes, to help long term strays who were deemed feral, as no one could get near to them.</p>
			<p>These cats had been overlooked, due to the length of time that they would need to be in foster care, she felt that they should be given the same chances and opportunities that other domestic cats had.</p>
			<p>Over the years we have spent many hours trapping street cats and also kittens who had they not come into our care early on in life would have become feral.</p>
			<p>Last year we had an incredibly hard situation, where a mother cat and her kittens had been dumped into an industrial bin. They had managed to flee when the bin was being emptied. We were walking the streets in the early ours of the morning, trying to get this little family back together. The mother cat was too traumatised to deal with the two kittens that we managed to save. Karen took the mother cat into care and the kittens were fostered and ended up in a loving home.</p>
			<p>We have had many success stories, where street cats lives have been turned around.</p>
			<p>Midnight Sykes is a prime example of this. Once the most hated cat in Sale, he is now an adorable cat, who helps others cats settle.</p>
