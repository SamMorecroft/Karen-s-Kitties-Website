			<h2>Meet Beautiful Bear</h2>
			<p>Bear is a male tabby aged somewhere between 2 & 3 years old, who just loves to be petted and fussed.</p>
			<p>He is a gentle boy who will reward you with purrs and head butts.</p>
			<p>We rescued Bear from the streets, where a kind lady had been feeding him. He is very loving and trusting boy with a really good appetite.</p>
			<p>At the moment, due  to his poor start in life, where he was fighting for survival,  he has no idea of how to play. I'm certain that once settled in a loving forever home, that will come in time.</p>
			<p>We are looking for a home, where Bear will be kept as an indoor only cat.  We believe that he would make a perfect companion cat.</p>
			<p>He has been, snap tested for Fiv & FeLV,(all negative), neutered, microchipped had his first vaccination including FeLV. (Feline leukaemia) plus has had both flea and worm treatments.</p>
			<p>If you would like to meet Bear with a view to offering him a home, please complete the <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">CAT ADOPTION FORM.</a></p>
