			<h2>URGENT REHOMING FOR MIN!</h2>
			<p>Through no fault of her own and because her mum is very poorly. We need to find a loving retirement home for Min as a cat on her own. She is 17 years old and in very good health and a very sweet girl who would make a companion cat in a quiet home. Karen's Kittie's stray cats and feral rescue are supporting the owner to find the right home. Please complete the <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">CAT ADOPTION FORM</a> if you are interested in this beautiful girl and giving her a retirement home.</p>
