			<h2>URGENT REHOMING FOR MIN'S!</h2>
			<p>Through no fault of her own and because her mum is very poorly. We need to find a loving retirement home for Min as a cat on her own. She is 17 years old and in very good health and a very sweet girl who would make a companion cat in a quiet home. Karen's Kittie's stray cats and feral rescue are supporting the owner to find the right home. Please complete the <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">CAT ADOPTION FORM</a> if you are interested in this beautiful girl and giving her a retirement home.</p>

			<h2>Bear is still looking for a home</h2>
			<p>Poor boy is so upset that no one has shown any interest in him at all. He was so sad that he had to be comforted by Karen.</p>
			<p>It would be lovely if Bear, who is aged somewhere between 2 & 3, could be settled in his forever home as a house cat by Christmas.</p>
			<p>He is such a good loving boy, absolutely no trouble at all. He just wants love, a full tummy and a safe place to live.</p>
			<p>He has been snap tested, results negative, castrated, microchipped, fully vaccinated including FeLV (feline leukaemia) and received both worm and flea treatments.</p>
			<p>We are looking for a home, where Bear will be kept as an indoor only cat.  We believe that he would make a perfect companion cat.</p>
			<p>He is good to go and is just waiting for that special person who will love him back and keep him safe.</p>
			<p>If you would like to meet Bear with a view to offering him a home, please complete the <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">CAT ADOPTION FORM.</a></p>
