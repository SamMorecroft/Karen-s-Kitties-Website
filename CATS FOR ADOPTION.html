			<h2>Midnight & Dora</h2>
			<p>These two beautiful well loved girls are with us, as sadly their heartbroken owner is suffering from ill health, and has selflessly made the decision to put them up for Adoption as a pair.</p>
			<p>Midnight is aged 6 years old and her daughter Dora is 4. Both girls are in good health and have been neutered, microchipped and recently had their first vaccinations with us.</p>
			<p>They have settled really well and are very adoptable. They are adorable and absolutely no trouble. They eat well and are using their litter tray.</p>
			<p>We made a promise to their Mum that we would not separate them.</p>
			<p>In time  once they have settled into their new home, they will be able to go outside. Therefore we are looking for them to be adopted into a safe area away from busy roads.</p>
			<p>If you would like to meet Midnight and Dora, with a view to offering them a home together, <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">please click here to complete the cat adoption form</a>. Thank you.</p>

			<h2>Fiona</h2>
			<p>We are looking for a very special home for Fiona who is around two years old, an indoor home with an experienced person of rescue cats who has patience who doesn't expect anything too soon.</p>
			<p>She has been through a horrible time been dumped in a park with two other cats.  She has been spay, snap tested and full vaccinations along with leukaemia and chipped.</p>
			<p>Why does she need this special home? because has been traumatised and was terrified, when we managed to rescue her on a freezing cold night out of a tree that she had ran up because absolutely in melt down.</p>
			<p>Please dont fall in love with her on appearance and only her psychological needs, we believe will make a loving companion with someone who lives alone or perhaps a couple in a quiet home.</p>
			<p>She needs to be rehomed as an indoor only cat, again a very safe indoor home with no escape route as unfortunately, when she moves to a new home will be a huge adjustment for her to settle and could take some months.  We have faith that with the right owner she will thrive and recover from her traumatic experience.  She is not feral but skitty and nervous.  She accepts strokes and love , enjoys food too. Please only get in touch if you are committed to making Fiona part of your life for a life time commitment and willing to give her long term time and patience as an indoor cat.</p>
