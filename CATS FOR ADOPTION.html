			<h2>URGENT HOME NEEDED FOR PRINCESS!</h2>
			<p>Sadly Princess is needing an urgent new home because is no longer happy at her present home due to her owner now having a young child.  When the child cries she tries to attack, she is very loving with adults but doesn't like other animals.</p>
			<p>Princess is 3 years old and been in the same home in that time,she has been neutered but is needing vaccinations and chipping. She has been used to going outside and I am sure will settle away from a main road in an adult home without other animals.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in giving her a loving home please complete the <a href="CAT ADOPTION FORM.html">CAT ADOPTION FORM.</a> Please give her a chance because the rehoming is through no fault of her own, is because she doesn't like young children. This is a private adoption but will be a home visit and Karen's Kittie's stray cats and feral Rescue will help with vaccinations and chipping.</p>
